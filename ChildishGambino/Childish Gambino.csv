5,All the Shine,https://genius.com/Childish-gambino-all-the-shine-lyrics,Camp,True,"What the fuck do y’all niggas really want?
I went with realness instead
But all the ""real niggas"" I know either crazy or dead
Yeah, I dropped the free EP for these other kids to feel a lot
Niggas keep asking on whether this dude’s for real or not
I’m not trying to come hard, I’m trying to come me
That’s why these older songs that I used to make I’d release free
What’s the point of rap if you can’t be yourself, huh?
That’s why I come first like my cell phone
I’m a role model, I am not these other guys
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly
I know it’s dumb, that’s the fucking reason I’m doing it
So why does everyone have a problem with talking stupid shit?
Or is it real shit?
‘Cause sometimes that stupid shit is real shit
Like when you make out with your best friend’s baby sis
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit?
You with a different girl like each and every fucking night
And kiss her while she’s sleeping and sneak out the front to catch a flight
That’s not life, dude
It's just making up for fucks I missed in high school
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one
’Cause I ain’t Mumford, I ain’t tryin’ to have sons
All I wanted was some more like Ashton
I ain’t the coolest but I know I got passion
I got passion!
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
“Baby, I’m on the edge” She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
I said, “Baby, I’m on the edge.” She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
I said, “Baby, I’m on the edge.” She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
I said, “Baby, I’m on edge.” Said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
Am I serious? I don’t even know
Are you hearing this? This shit is laughable
I ain’t trying, I’m doing, these other rappers are foolish
I got fame, my A&R’s a computer
Is there room in the game for a lame who rhymes?
Who wears short shorts and makes jokes sometimes?
My nigga like, “I’d get you MTV if I could, man
But Pitchfork only likes rappers who crazy or hood, man”
So, I guess we gon' see
I ain’t Curren$y, but if there ain’t money in my name please murder me
Sometimes I feel like I ain't supposed to be here
Sometimes I wake up, I don't want to be here
My mom loves to text me Psalm verses
She don’t look at me like I’m the same person
I used to be the sweet one, but things change
And I don’t want her missing a son like Bon’s last name
And all my uncles alcoholics, shame on me
I drink whiskey till I’m grounded, no TV
I wanna go inside the club with no gold piece
And walk in with no I.D. and No I.D
No matter how far the hood seems
We all still got hood dreams
I always wanted to get picked on the cool team
But alone is exactly how I should be
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
We need to find
We need to find"
7,All Yall,https://genius.com/Childish-gambino-all-yall-lyrics,STN MTN / Kauai,True,"Now it's the B to the izzo
You know what it is I'mma stunt on the d-low
Watch me get it in, spin in the seat, black as can be
Rolling it up, giving a fuck, like I'm a slut
""Bino that's my baby what he doin out at the club?""
Fuck about your dress code, my dress code is I got a big bank roll
I think so, time to give these niggas something else
Island in the summer best believe that shit ain't common wealth
Smile on her face best believe she wearing nothing else
Watch the sun set that's a feeling that she never felt
We were born free, that's my God given
How a god living? Fantastic, fans spazz when they see ya man passing
I'm in the Aston Martin, unforgivable blackness beg your pardon
On my Jack Johnson nigga, all my shows sell tix like Boston nigga
Put this on at the cook out, let me see you shmoney
Old school on the XM got your Auntie singing ""Hola Hola Ayy""
Hit the dream too hard, I'm the new young god
This the new mixtape, but it's still the same game
How you gon be the don, when Don half my name?
How you gon be the G.O.A.T, when we are not the same?
I be feeling all this money but motherfuck the fame
It's the young Bino, I'm in your bae like Oakland
In my bed out of breath I never been this open
If you niggas can't hear me it's the weed I'm smoking
When I opened up the door I had the manager coughing like
""The hotels charging you a maintenance fee""
Gave that nigga 2 stacks and said I'm here all week
Let me roll OG, let me talk my shit
How you hotter than me? You ain't got no hits
You just got a hot feature
Bare sole on the track so my feet hurt
Do some research, know my origin
I'm the new black, fuck oranges
Yeah, that's that nigga that yall love to hate
Redbone like golden gate
Childish y'all know the name, getting hate from Charlemagnes
Last year things done changed, I was thinking bout killing y'all
I was working all night long, white bitches like King Kong
Getting money my theme song, do whatever I want
Fuck your clique do what I want, fuck your bitch do what I want
Here's some shit you niggas didn't know
Probably wrote your nigga verse
Probably wrote your nigga video
High as fuck on Arsenio
Chosen, now they show me my respect nigga
Frozen, Disney movie round his neck nigga
I told ya, I'm the best right now
From Atlanta where them niggas in your chest like ""blow""
Royalty equal sign black philosophers
Became a top 5 cause nobody else was stopping us
They want me Hopsin but I'm popping and getting confident
God forbid we give him props for the job he did
Man his knob need some slobbering
I mean, fuck, do you want more?
I'm killing these niggas and still on tour
Fuck is y'all for?
This is for all of y'all
One day everyone's falling off
So right now we should all ball out
Life's too short to not all out
This is for all of y'all
One day everyone's falling off
So right now we should all ball out
Life's too short to not all out
I don't know what I really need
But I'd rather be smoking weed
I don't know what I really need, yeah
But I'd rather be smoking weed"

Mixtape demonstrations
This Oxycontin carbon monox' and toxic concoction
Collapse your brain cells, they swell from lack of oxygen
Leave the opposition stuck, without a pot to piss in
Hockin', spitting up blood, shark by sharp precision
Dart incision, darkness imparts your vision
Sparks infliction, I'm a mad magician
Verbal plasma, verbal scatter, words that shatter
Every atom in your body, now you're anti-matter
Ripping through the data, checked into the doctor
Took his rhyme splatter, cause my mind's faster
You falling down to ground, while I climb the ladder
Too much garbage in your gallbladder, fall flatter
On your face, now you carry by the pall-bearer
Or wear the black suit, eyes all teared up
Oh no, when your ho make a boss lit up
We in the rib with a smirk nigga, all geared up
Childish Gambino or Bobby Digi'lino on the tracks
We breaking more backs that Sammartino, Bruno
We saw more baselines than Juno
Change more law in New York than Mr. Cuomo
Godfather novels I write like Mario Puzo
Master time fix the clocks like I'm Hugo
Hold the weight like nine sumos
Bust shots like John Lugo
You know how the Wu go
Look sharp, homie give yourself a facelift
High brow, eyebrows on a spaceship
Take sips of that Ace of Spades-es
Saving all my money just to waste on a bracelet
Can't see them haters, we don't give a fuck though
Charge it to the game, keep a lame so cutthroat
Never slip a fast one, the game is so in front of me
Travel 'round the globe, spend and make 'bout a 100 G's
Pack them crowds up, boss like Bowser
Deep pocket poetry, my custom trousers
Thank God they found us, the game was starvin'
I'm clean and concrete, you ass and Charmin
Bobby Digital, do you really think these niggas know shit?
Shopping in Manhattan and I ran into my old chick
Pride is a bitch, I am not a grown up
Tweetin' when I'm 70, these half-dead followers
She look like she Spelman, secretly she Hofstra
Put her in the club, all she wanna hear is Waka
Put her in the crib, all she wanna hear is Waka
She jerk when I move like her old boy popped her
Home is that Outkast, soul like I'm Phonte
Old-school J's like Beyoncé's fiancé
Back on my dumb shit, nigga we the stupidest
Gave them niggas real shit, don't know what to do with it
I did what I did man, did you really see it though?
'Bino hard and fast, niggas Sweet'N Low
American Royalty, family loyalty
We cream of the crop why the fuck would we stop?
She had two sons: both of 'em good grades
Both of 'em rap songs
Where did she go wrong?
Nowhere mama, we just go where the money at
Black Kennedy, where the fuck you niggas at?"
12,Arrangement,https://genius.com/Childish-gambino-arrangement-lyrics,Royalty,True,"This is Royalty
Bang bang
I got yo bitch layin' naked 'cross the bed, no rosary
Stackin' up this bread like a baker, Josephine
She wanna refill, so I get that ho a bean
Niggas on the sideline yellin' ""Who the fuck is he?""
Bitch I'm @Gonage, you can call me Cody B
Wardrobe overseas, passports all over me
White leather seats lookin' like coca leaf
Every time I crank up the woofer sittin' on a key
I'm Gucci buckled up, house note on my feet
Linen button-up like I'm walkin' round on the beach
Blind hoes notice me in my Range Rover Jeep
So they wanna come and talk to me like Jodeci
Smokin' in the morning, and when I go to sleep
Blowin' presidential man, I think they 'about to vote for me
Any event we party like a frat, no toga sheet
If money ain't the convo, they ain't even 'posed to speak
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
In the VIP we champagne-spray shit
I'm in the club lookin' like a bank statement
If you talkin' cash, I can make arrangement
Walked in the club, ain't pay shit
Broke niggas hate, cause they ain't shit
I'm gettin' to the cash pockets on payment
If you talkin' money, I can make arrangement
Cody
Cody Bean Senior, pushin' mean ether
You don't know Childish? Nigga, me neither
Eastside Atlanta, flyest nigga in a Waffle House
If it ain't money, man, we ain't got shit to talk about
Kennedy compound, my 20-room house
So big my ex-girls ain't gotta move out
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
My bank account looking like when little kids break shit—""Oooh!""
If I'm breathin' I can handle it
Watching all my dreams get together like an ampersand
Blueprint the new shit, mixtape management
Show these dummies how to do it, all I want's my ten percent
Porsche brand new, passed 'em a cool hundred
Yeah my girl 5'2"", even her growth stunted
It's the nigga y'all knew back when I flipped meal cards
Now my meals free when I don't taste the fifth star
We can make arrangements, old money Cambridge
Meetin' with the moguls, make 'em richer and they owe you
It's the kid you used to talk about, I'm watchin' people get up on it
On Worldstar and I ain't have to have a nigga moment
Flow's always cold, keep the whole soul anemic
Never left that hard shit, a nigga's always constipated
Got the change for my cousin on froze, no more movin' weight
Flossin' hard, ice king, no more Finn and Jake
Love or hate you gotta say the hype is something handsome
As long as all of 'em bloggin' I'm living Richard Branson
Shit talk is still talk, haters are my billboard
Used to take the Q home, now I hang with ScHoolboy
So iconic, Black Kennedy this shit
Man I'm so ironic, man this ratchet need a fix
Droppin' new shit and the haters get the splashback
Don't be surprised when he ask you where the cash at
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
In the VIP we champagne-spray shit
I'm in the club lookin' like a bank statement
If you talkin' cash, I can make arrangement
Walked in the club, ain't pay shit
Broke niggas hate, cause they ain't shit
I'm gettin' to the cash pockets on payment
If you talkin' money, I can make arrangement

Is it too much to ask for lyrics?
I mean it's 2014 man, c'mon really
You niggas could learn a lot by now
Watch this
Stone Mountain
Give a fuck about these haters man
I'm the flyest that there's ever been
I'm always reppin' Stone Mountain
You know my show is sold out
You know my smoke is so loud
And still about his business
Stay up out my business, flow so vicious
When niggas talkin' shit, shut they mouth, that's what this is
I walk up in the party, we took all the bitches
They love how I move, we might need a minute
God damn, Summer looking like son of Sam, I'm killin' niggas
Hang with models and a couple strippers
She love my music so I nutted in her
Damn I'm decent, Liam Neeson
I'm takin' over, you playing sober
Gassed up and you finished last
I'm crying nigga, that's tear gas
Woooh, now I'm flexing
Was that fire? Bitch you guessed it 
I bet you I can make that ass hot
C'mon bae, drop it like a ass shot
Say my sixteen will make that ass hot
Song done, drop it like a ass shot
Boy stuntin' got they ass hot
Go on nigga, drop 'em like a ass shot
Jump on this beat and get they ass hot
Go on girl, drop it like a ass shot
I am, the prince, two cups, always
Our team, got money, we stunt hard, so don't hate
Fall off, no way, we run it, it's too late
We smoke sour, call that flowers
I just blew, a bouquet
My girl, so sweet, like Crème brûlée
But still, she that hood, like red Kool-Aid
We on top, toupée, I got hits, like touché
I just did Rome in one day
I just flew out to Croat-ia
I'm independent man and still doin' major
Young King so flashy got me lookin' like lazers
Atlanta housewife I can make ya like Phaedra
So let's play my, I'mma play ya
Get bands, then head to la playa
My niggas is bias
My brothers the owner, fuck with 'em get higher
G-lover spit fire, that flame is saliva
We're riders that got Nick Cannon's now
Make 'em drop you like Mariah, wassup?
I bet you I can make that ass hot
C'mon bae, drop it like a ass shot
Say my sixteen will make that ass hot
Song done, drop it like a ass shot
Boy stuntin' got they ass hot
Go on nigga, drop 'em like a ass shot
Jump on this beat and get they ass hot
Go on girl, drop it like a ass shot
Start her off with gin and tonic, mine's a double
Out in Vegas fool, you know I'm bettin' double
Double your car note, double your mama rent
Ain't shit but house money, I ain't spent a cent
Mo' money mo' problems, yeah that's official
I just throw cash at it, that's my issue, it's hard
So I feed my boo boo hard that moo moo bags until she...
If she need mo', then girl I miss you, bye
But ain't no lookin' back
Cause I know it's a salt pile 
I'm goin' Chevy with metallic fuckin' gun style
No door handle, she high tryna figure how
While my auto mobile looks like Girls Gone Wild
That's top off, nigga drop offs
Slidin' dirty with yo' dame
OG sativa baby, watch ahead for that air plane
Fuck with my money, and I'm at your house like the mail came
You meet the Swank lion, beast mode, untamed
I bet you I can make that ass hot
C'mon bae, drop it like a ass shot
Say my sixteen will make that ass hot
Song done, drop it like a ass shot
Boy stuntin' got they ass hot
Go on nigga, drop 'em like a ass shot
Jump on this beat and get they ass hot
Go on girl, drop it like a ass shot
Big homie have you seen her
She got the Dobrev, all white Nina
Packed like Serena, or maybe Trina
Shit I don't know, they both got ass
So of course he came to give you all these courses
And you can't ignore 'em, cause these hoes adore 'em
Words hot, don't slur 'em
I just speak up, so please ho, keep up
Please ho, keep up
Ok, ok, ok, she ain't getting money, no way
I met her on a Monday, but I fucked her back to Sunday
I told her she my Brandy, I'm her one and only Wanya
Till she drove off the driveway in her '97 Hyundai, bitch"
17,Baby Boy,https://genius.com/Childish-gambino-baby-boy-lyrics,"“Awaken, My Love!”",True,"Little hands, little feet
Tiny heart, tiny beat
Oh, thinkin' 'bout the time we spent falling in love together
I don't wanna leave you, I don't wanna deceive you
But oh, when mama cries from daddy's lies
Oh my, please don't take him away, mama
Don't take him away, oh
'Cause I've had my time, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close, I hope I stay close
All the pain, all the tears
Many nights, many years
This love for me is fading
You waited, but I never came home to you
I've never lied about us
We were never supposed to be together
When you see me with some other one
And they know your son
Oh, please don't take him away
You say you won't but you will, yes you will
'Cause I've had my time, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close, I hope I stay close
There was a time before you
And there will be a time after you
Though these bodies are not our own
Walk tall, little one, walk tall
Let me hold you, let me hold you
Can I hold you?"
19,Backpackers,https://genius.com/Childish-gambino-backpackers-lyrics,Camp,True,"Alright it's Childish baby, Mr. Talk-About-His-Dick-Again
Nerdy-ass black kid, whatever, man, I'm sick of him
That well-spoken token, who ain't been heard
The only white rapper who's allowed to say the N-word
I buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card
Now I got some street cred, use it 'til it's maxed out
I got a girl on my arm, dude, show respect
Something crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech
She too fine, I do dimes
If not that, I'm walking out with two fives
Change my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet
Black male in short shorts, I'm double suspect
Ballin' since '83, half of 'em say he gay
Maybe that's the reason I like Lady What-babies-say
I'm a problem, I'm lame as fuck homie
But I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me
Fuck the cool kids, not Chuck Inglish
But people who think that hatin on me makes them distinguished
Like, ""What is this nigga doin? Rap is for real blacks
I hate that fucking faggot, man, he think that we feel that""
Or ""I wrote on rape culture my junior year at Brown
So I'm allowed to say what all his raps are about""
You better shut your mouth before I fuck it
You really hate my lyrics now or Kid Cudi's? Nigga
Runnin this thang, money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name?
In the woods, got these niggas usin' Mapquest
Man, fuck a backpacker
Niggas with OCD, N-W-O
All white like my clothes, CW shows
Nigga got signed, it's an anomaly
No cosign: trigonometry
Man these niggas hate me
""Man, fuck you nigga...fuck you nigga!""
They real black like won't show up on your camera phone
They real black like turn the flash on your camera on
They real black take shit, turn it into gold
I'm real black I survive when the pressure on
Upper echelon, bit my lip when I'm kissin' her
Clash of the Titans, baby your tits is titular
Listenin to some Kiss FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj
""Super Bass,"" super face inside a garage
It's not a massage, spa rap with a happy ending
Old niggas wanna assassinate me
It's a shame, these kids was supposed to save rap
Fuck that, boat shoes and a wave cap
He don't give back, how the fuck a nigga say that?
Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach
Comin' on that payback, comin' on that mace took
I'm comin' on that real shit, I'm comin' on her Facebook
Fuck a backpacker with a rhino's dick
I do me like a gyno chick, uh
Runnin this thang, money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name?
In the woods, got these niggas usin' Mapquest
Man, fuck these backpackers
Fuck these backpackers
Fuck these backpackers
Fuck these backpackers"
20,Be Alone,https://genius.com/Childish-gambino-be-alone-lyrics,EP,True,"I don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone
‘Cause ya know, somewhere inside, I cannot find
The feeling I got from you
No, somewhere inside, I cannot find
The feeling I got from you, oh
Hard for a Pitchfork, soft for a Roc-a-Fella
Music was my side chick, but now we’re moving in together
Always felt misunderstood, I guess I have to tolerate
My swag Jehovah Witness, dude, it never take a holiday
APC jeans, brown leather jacket on
Kitsuné cable knit, cardigan from Rag & Bone
Thick Filipino chick, homemade bracelet
Her booty make her just a rapper, she ain’t gotta say shit
I’m someone they admire
Set the game ablaze, I’m an arcade fire
Laughed at my rise like my motion was funny
Yes, ashy to classy, my lotion is money
The ride is easy when the dollar’s there to grease the wheels
Now everybody tell me what to do and how to feel
It seems the more I try to connect with the world
I am feeling more alone than I ever have felt before
I wanna pick up the phone, ask my dad how to handle it
But what will happen when my dad’s not there to answer it?
I try to clear my mind of thoughts that only slow me down
Like when these niggas called me ""faggot"" and we homies now
But we are not homies, I just keep you around
‘Cause all your talkin’ is the noise I need to kill the sound
Of all these voices tellin’ me no one can help me out
We are alone, I’m just the only one to figure out
I don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone
‘Cause ya know, somewhere inside, I cannot find
The feeling I got from you
No, somewhere inside, I cannot find
The feeling I got from you, oh
""You are the bestest, I will obey you""
These words I wrote for you when you were fuckin’ other dudes
The only thing I need from you now is some solitude
Actions over words, ""girls will be girls,"" that’s all it proves
I used to be this guy sittin’ with an open heart
Now my computer screen’s the only place I feel a spark
I don’t fuck with fake bitches
Except for when I fuck with fake bitches
Canon 5D to take pictures
Of these girls who wouldn’t talk to me a year ago
49er chick askin’ for money, she get zero, though
Here I go again, talkin’ money, women and clothes and cars, right?
You could switch all of my words out with Plies’, right?
People sayin’ we’re the same, please, come from under me
We are just some rappers, got no luxury of subtlety
No subjects when we’re rappin’, we say it like we hear it
I put it on a track and I hope you get the spirit ‘cause
I don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone
‘Cause ya know, somewhere inside, I cannot find
The feeling I got from you
No, somewhere inside, I cannot find
The feeling I got from you"

Really everything, like the headphones
Yeah, yeah, a little bit louder

Look, young rich nigga shit, pops was an immigrant
Lifestyle ill legit, but know I own businesses
Started out the trunk, ended up at the dealership
All gold Rollie, black face no blemishes
Legend in my city cause I grind so vigorous
If I show my face west of Texas, that's a big event
Gotta pay me twenty cents just to hear me vent
I'm really out here on some shit, you should take a flick
Ballin' on my own ten toes, so the difference is
I call shots never ask for permission, man
I got a lot of big plans in my vision and
I ain't failed yet, 'bout a dollar hell yes
I'm a problem-filled test, it's only getting worse
I swear I'm getting money, I just hope you gettin' yours
I'm killin' niggas solo so you know I'm gettin' more
Now that young Gambino on the chorus, go
This is for that real shit, this is for that East side
This is for my bad girls, this is for them good guys
This is for my grandma, this is for that Westside

League of my own, swag Geena Davis
Only rapper make 100k on your playlist
Niggas talk on Twitter, but in life, they don't say shit
My Rollie so racist, all black faces
We the new facet, kill 'em like Jason
Grind in my sleep man a nigga need braces
Wonder what you feelin' like, used to be the nervous type
They ain't mention Bino? Man that shit must be on purpose, right?
Hostile, nigga my style
Kind of flow to paint a picture, Norman Rockwell
I don't eat pasta, everything is low-carb
I don't fly coach now, say I fly Goyard
Leave a face covered in that coast guard
Metaphor Mozart, all we do is tell 'em the truth
M Fox to my people on some family ties
Magazines got black faces when somebody dies
I mean look at Donna Summers, she was tryin' to survive
People wrestle over petty cash
When we should be really cryin' over that one percent
Like we tipped a milk glass
Fuck y'all, I'ma let my grandkids ball
Look to the future, these dudes so last week
See me stuntin' so Conde Nasty
Me and Nipsey on some grown shit, no rent
Own shit, so Jim Crow shit, black faces
Ay, nigga, black faces
Black faces
That's royalty, nigga"

Hot like a parked car
I sound weird, like ""nigga"" with a hard 'R'
Fly like the logo on my cousin’s 440
Eatin’ Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin’ in the islands, lookin’ for Earl like Toejam
I made the beat retarded, so I’m callin’ it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
Cause I’m a beast, bitch, ""grrr"" - Invader Zim

Told me I should just quit: “First of all, you talk white!
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet""
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can’t even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that’s a mixtape
Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shoutout to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me cause your little cousin play me out
I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin' ""Owwww""
I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin’ with a Filipina, at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I’m in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don’t bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I’m screamin’ “What the fuck is up?” like I ain't seen the sky

Just enough to get, to get my rows in a duck
Just enough to make a faithful man wanna fuck

And most of 'em couldn't handle the panels in my comic's book
This rapper's book, this writer's book
They kinda shook, it's not a hook
They kinda shook, it's not a hook

Cutting into my skin

And 107.9 was 97.5 again
And they played me at Golden Glide on Friday
And they played me real loud on the street
We drive up Memorial Drive, up Wesley Chapel
I reopen 112, and Jazzy T's
I'd bring back Turner Field. I fire all the cops in Cobb county
Chick-Fil-A will be open on Sundays
I bring back LaFace Records, Freaknik, Kilo Ali, Lou
I get J.R. Crickets some Spelman girls with big booties
I reopen SciTrek, strippers will get Mother's Day off
And I'd have my own Gangsta Grillz mixtape

After selling 10 million copies of his newest album
Roscoe's Wetsuit in one week!
After successfully petitioning to recarve his own face into Stone Mountain

They come to getcha when they grope in your mind
They think you creepy, getting down in your mind
They come to getcha, they come to getcha
It doesn't matter, you making magic
I got the business to make a mind
I got the business to make a mind
And if you feel it, if you feel in your toes
And you act nothing like nobody knows

I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak

I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff type
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that this song's coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you, the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
The text say that ""It's not fair""
That's code for ""He's not here""
And I'ma flirt with this new girl
And I'ma call if it don't work
So we fuck 'til we come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we were losing
I'm a ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place

It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go 100
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she wanna play games
With the Super Smash Brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
69 is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that smoke
And light
I wanted you to know

So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his post on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you ate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related: racist
I give you money, then you burn me, then you made off
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, ""What the fuck you hiding?""
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Ayo, fuck this
Are we dating? Are we fucking?
Are we best friends? Are we something? In between that?
I wish we never fucked, and I mean that"

""You such a fuckin' lame!""
It's what they used to yell back in seventh grade
My mama said she'd get me that new jacket when the cost go down
Hit the office, stole some Tommy Hill from lost and found
Not bad for a family of foster child
Lookin' fly man, I'm flossin' now
But them niggas saw through me
""Are you serious? What is this?""
Took the jacket off third period, ellipsis
Listening to ""Sky Is the Limit"" on my Walkman
Thinking if Biggie can make it through it, man then I can
Dope-boy swag, I always wanted that
But my persona was always more of that Arthur Ashe
But no love for the son of a commuter who was a radio head
And okay at them computers at the post office
It's funny how you smoke niggas then you start coffins
All my people need throat lozenge
My fear is dead, ambition drove the hearse
But niggas got me feelin' I ain't black enough to go to church
Culture shock at barber shops cause I ain't hood enough
We all look the same to the cops, ain't that good enough?
The black experience is black and serious
Cause being black, my experience, is no one hearin' us
White kids get to wear whatever hat they want
When it comes to black kids one size fits all

We the baddest nigga, we the baddest

The reason that they say I'm nothin' what they seen or heard's
The same reason Will Smith always opposite Latino girls
They only see you how they wanna see you
'Til you make them see you in some other way
I'm trippin' off the other day
'Cause God knows what these white kids say and do
You're not not racist 'cause The Wire's in your Netflix queue
Subtle racism, it's hard to pin it
'Cause you'd only understand if you were me for just a minute
This one kid said somethin' that was really bad
He said I wasn't really black because I had a dad
I think that's kinda sad
Mostly 'cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that
If you're a father, you should stick around if you could
'Cause even if you're bad at it, you could Tiger Woods or MJ
We warriors, we all need senseis
Change everything that we've done so far
I don't mean makin' B.E.T. T.E.R
I mean just the way that we see each other
I won't stop until they say:
""James Franco is the white Donald Glover""
Yeah, these niggas wanted Cookie, but instead I gave 'em Loch Ness
Sick Boi for life, my swag is in a hospice
Aimin' for the throne, Jay and Ye said to watch that
They ask me what I'm doin', and I said I'm stealin' rock back

And none of this ever ended
Everything just kept going, and going, and going
And even when you laughed, you cried
And even when you were sad, you were really happy
Cause you were here, and I got to meet every star
Every planet, everything that made me
And we all kissed, and became the same
We became the same, we became the same.""
Who would have thought this? We almost lost it
When you lie inside darkness, it's hard to see
And we sleep in tradition, keep 'em off in the distance
To tell you that I haven't been
We are all cold water
Why try at all? Why bother?
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Who would have dreamed this? You couldn't mean this
It would be some type of meanness to where you are
'Cause I don't know where to go
And no one else seems to know
We are all night's fallen
Why try at all? Dark calling
So we're left alone, no one left to call upon
Be still now, broken bones, as I travel on
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Hold me close, my darling

See, now I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
When the world was discerned with this and that
I was young, didn't know to hold it back
Now we here and the world is something else
We could leave any day and call for help
We were gods, nobody was above me 
That ""A"" on my chest like adultery 
That ""A"" on my chest, put your fist up 
That ""A"" on my chest like a chipmunk

Take on my soul

Yeah, break free from all of the insides
The godless denied us
But we don't give a damn 'bout the next day
We were never here, never know if the world change
Common sense, the consequences
Retweet the truth, then regret the mentions
We are the wireless survivors of things gone
Slaves to the unnamed never live long
Live and die by the line ""Never know fear""
Even I won't survive, is it unfair?
Is it unfair? Cause I don't care
When I step on that ant on the grass
Progress only thing that'll last 
3005, the year that we fear only God will survive
To be alone is alive

Man made the web, you don't need a name 
Man made of faults, I ain't too ashamed
Every thought I had, put it in a box 
Everybody see it just before the cops
Trolling, trolling, trolling these niggas
Rick Rolling these niggas, they mad cause they don't know any better
""Hold up, it's the kid—quick, tell him he can't sit with us!""
Fuck it, got money, bought friends like I'm TBS
VVS, I can see it all with the clarity
Real deep, hope they dig a nigga 'fore they bury me
Even though we were told to go where they wouldn't go
Hella slow, that's that dial up, watch it pile up, fly

Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer

Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
We are the dreams of our parents lost in the future
Who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha—
Door open, we were smoking in the hotel
The vapors went through the hallway, the manager pissed as hell
I mean, where's the line between Donny-G and Gambino?
He hang with girls like he Lena, but needed some time to re-up
Tequila in the cantina, 30 dollars I swallowed
The Sauza so malo 
Then she said, ""You need to grow up
You been doing this for too long
That Camp was a million years ago, sing me a different song.""
Whether you're trolling or controlling, just a reminder
You think you get it, you don't, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
I'm gone—Now I'm back
Give a fuck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react
Tyler Durden, this burden hurting, they said there was curtains
Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent
I could've stayed where I was and had a life you'd be proud of
But I'd rather chase things never thought of
It was all love, saying, ""Go hard""
Making dope, it's a trap; Ackbar backfired
Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die
I had to figure it out; ""It's the best,"" no, that's a lie
Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized
High on my own, it took time to realize
Because the internet, mistakes are forever
But if we fuck up on this journey, at least we're together
Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe
Make him believe in himself, people who needed my help
Feelings I felt, killing myself, no one's ever been this lost
I just get the information, retweet it or say it sucks
I just got the motivation, your talent's just bunch of luck
Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok
Waking up in these places I don't remember
Texts from people I never met, doors left open
(Who is this? Don't do it, where are you?
Who is this? Who is this) I don't know who I am anymore
Still on the beat though
Still in the game, but he move with a cheat code
Slowest connection ever, my life inside a computer
Them bands that'll make her dance, my wallet's Lollapalooza
The violence, first-person shooter
First person to move, first person to speak
My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets
Losing my frame of reference, these pieces of shit for breakfast
Funny, the day you born, that's really your death sentence
I met this girl at a dinner, we conversatin'
She beautiful in the face, but her voice is truly amazing
Plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit
Smoke up and talk in the evening, she helping me focus
No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers
Niggas take her props, like a musical, live and learn
She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar
I meet her in my dreams, on the moon, I visit her
Every night I text her: ""I wanna solve the world, I think I need your help""
She text me, ""How you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?""
I mean she right though, 45 like a light-bulb
And I could've died like my iPhone but I kept going like a psycho
And I took chance like a dice roll, dropping jewels like it's puberty
Wrote a note on the glass: ""You see what these labels do to me?""
Texts said, ""I'm wet""; I said, ""Hold up, wait a minute""
H2O plus my D, that's my hood, I'm living in it
Never forget this feeling, never gon' reach a million
Eventually all my followers realize they don't need a leader
Stay on your own shit, fuck what these clones think
Just remember that you the shit, but act like it don't stink
We were childish, but had to grow up
When you spitting real shit, eventually you throw up
Realities like allergies, I'm afraid to go nuts
""Life: The Biggest Troll"", but the joke is on us
Yeah, the joke's you showed up
You're here now
You have to help me
You have to help me
I need you—you have to help me
You have to help me
You have to help me
Please help me
Please help me
Please, please help me

LA, it's ya girl, Yesi Ortiz
Got some brand-new music
I need y'all to turn it up and let me know what you think
It's Lloyd, called ""Oakland"", on Power 106.""
I was making Japanese
And she's watching DVDs
In Oakland, in Oakland
Now I'm driving up the 5
And she waits til' I arrive
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything, that I wanted
Only gotta drive for the moment
If you tell me ""turn around,"" then I'm on it
For the moment, but you know me
You know how I get when I'm lonely
And I think about you and the moments
But everything you do is so Oakland, so Oakland
Foot on the gas
I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
Before I get to The Bay
Babe, that's a problem
Because I'm way too scared to call
And you might get me to stay, and oh
I don't really mind the drive
But I think I'd rather die
In Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends
On Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old
In Oakland, in Oakland
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything, that I needed
Now that I got you in your feelings
Everything you won't say, you tweet it
And a nigga don’t like that shit at all
So treated
Can we just roll with the feeling?
Can we just roll for a minute?
Wait a minute
Foot on the gas
I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
But I'm really not ready, girl
That's a problem
'Cause I'm way too scared to fall
And I know you choose to stay, and oh
All the girlfriends saying ""here we go again""
Rich kid but he act like a gentleman
Last one didn't end like it should've been
Two dates and he still wanna get it in
And they're saying it's because of the Internet
Try her once and it's on to the next chick
X-O the O face on your exes...right?
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have at it
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at it
I was thinking 'bout me, I'd be really bad at it
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah we can try
So let's try
Whoa
I took off my nine to five
But you still don't have the time to kiss me, just hit me
And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone?
It's iffy, you miss me
I got furniture to move
And we'll both be thirty soon
In Oakland, in Oakland
The only one I know is you, so the fuck I'm supposed to do?
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland

Man is a star bound to a body inside of me
20 million degrees, burn a man to his knees
Late at night in a hurry bought a McFlurry
And half of an apple pie, when I'm laughing, I'm satisfied
When I'm dying, I'm still alive, strange position
I'm in a good mood, so good, I'ma kill that spider
In spite of the kinda things that they told me
Alone don't mean that you lonely
Alone means you finally get it, admit it
Go home, lock up the door, fold up the clothes
Watch some cartoons, turn off the lights
Look at the recluse, look at the recluse
Look at the recluse, look at the rec—

Shame shame on my brown ass
Birds in the trees as we run through
And if I'm dead to the world, what you gon' do?
What you gon' do? Like, ""I can't remember""
Shots fired, rewind, please, girl, be mine
Email denied, talk to me baby
Before I go crazy, might do it maybe
We were so Jay Z, Beyonce, my aunt say ""keep the sex game picante""
The Aunt May and Mary Jane that I was hitting on
To make me try and forget that there was something wrong
Love is Russian roulette, I had the safety on
We popped pills at the Coachella
Hold my head in the weeds, man I can't tell her
The fear that I feel man it might kill her
Man, it might kill her, it's the prep school mic killa'
With the drums and the groove so it feel Dilla
I don't care what he say
I'ma get my platinum back like I'm a half ton gorilla
You can hang with homie on the low
But your boy so weak like a week ago
But we ain't speaking though
We ain't speaking, we ain't speaking though
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you 
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you

Love me better, kiss me back, listen -

Makin' movies with her friends all the time
Showin' off her ass, that's a net twerk

Drive slow 'cause you might swerve off it
Still eat and the hate so salty
Put shrooms in my roommate's coffee
And got more likes than a white girl talking
More hits than a fight comp
Where they fight cops 'til they stop, when I heard shots
Watching dude drop from a Glock at a—

Ass out to the whole world

Stepping outside for a light
No coke and I just smoke vapor, no papers
Slow poke and I don't know 'bout photos
Let's go though
How old are you?
Saying that you never date older dudes
That's why I never wanna say no to you
The coldest dude to hold a groove with no kids
The coldest dude who can't hold his Goose

What about dude?
""Fuck him, I just really wanna feel something""

I am five foot eight, 390

Heathen, it's a struggle just to keep breathing
Existential asthmatic, puff puff pass addict
Craftmatic, making moves but they sleeping on me
We can kick it like it's FIFA, homie, nevertheless
I got that fresh like it was Crest, grind 'cause I'm stressed
TMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living
I never understood the hate on a nigga preference
When every marriage is a same sex marriage
Same sex everyday, monotonous, Lost God, never pray
Forgotten us, lost love, never say just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a watch tower
And anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait 'til I'm walking in it with a gun that they 3D printed and finish it

Why do it by two inches? Old money and new bitches
Old money and new bitches

The boat in the harbor, I rule the marina

I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid

Rather blast a Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura
Acting blacker than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys and Akon

Where are they from? We were playing PlayStation

Got a glass house in the Palisades, that A-K-A
White hood, white hood, O-KKK

I know it's coming quick, wishin' I could fast forward
Tell these nice girls they're the reason that I'm an asshole
Omega to alpha male, because of that dollar bill

I called her ass for two months, ain't heard shit from her

The chips are up and on my shoulder, you heard me?
I take it out on girls who don't even deserve it
The girls I tried to hit last year, I still might
Karma's a bitch who doesn't suck, but I still like

Black and white girls always come wit' a set of politics
That’s all that I was sayin', I’m a proud man
They wanna holler when they see your name on SoundScan
Her name Mercedes, but she push a brown Focus
And she’s doin' coke in front of me, but act like I don’t notice
There ain't breakage in that Trojan? She see what she wanna see
So I make her take Plan B in front of me
Women talk shit on men like all day
But it's Pete Wentz, goes both ways
They too busy stabbin' hoes like OJ
They too busy trappin' pros like Kobe
The only thing I put before me is ""Do, re""
If you had told me the truth, we’d be ok
If we were kids, I'd want to give
You everything that you would want
Those other boys, they give you toys

And we were looking at the stars
And this girl was laying next to me
And the blanket that we had was, had stars on it as well
So it looked liked we were just floating in an abyss
Honestly, when I see her face I just smile I guess
I mean, our cars came and the lights were on on them so we could see what the waves look like
I'll be waiting here on the sand
I remember that first night
You were wearing a power ranger black T-shirt
So was I, a different color, so was Moey and his brother
Not as pure, so insecure
The times have changed
But really we just looked up at the stars
For a couple hours, turned off all the lights on the cars
The world was ours it was yours—it was mine
The time flew by like it was prime time and I'm inside of
Life, you shouldn't be my wife you should just be with me
On this beautiful night
Maybe we can make things right
Maybe we can do it without any spite
It's just for tonight, and we hope it doesn't end
So we drive back to our homes chilling with our friends
Balling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him
If we met bet it would be awkward break out the Sudafed
Cause the flow cold, like a SoCo
I was smoking smoking John Lennon where my Yoko?
This that call yo grandma you ain't ready yet
Verbal mania, imma show you the illest, get my cousin to kill it
Had a flow but you steal it, I'm in the mood so we ball out
Got the top down in the back we could fall out
We could fall out, nigga we could fall out
Your girlfriend push a Prius, she giving me that genius
Mensa, we that Tony Danza
Wine on the rug man you know that shit expensive
I'm on that Willy Wonka, green so Blanka
Vape so good and the pot like lobster
Nigga, I'm a monster, fuck it, I'm a mon-star
Man, I got this beat I'm going ham like a cop car
That's unless you see me pulling up on the boulevard
Turn them flashing lights, at least you know who you really are

But I can't leave you behind
You know that I never wanted to see what's on your mind
Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn
Yo it's kinda hard not to like, get fucking cheesy on this shit
But, does that even matter?
You know what I'm saying, juxtaposition man
Juxta-fucking-position
My nigga Jaden Smith dropping jewels and niggas don't believe him cause he's Jaden Smith
But it's all about packaging right?
Real shit though, good and bad is all relative man
It really is, a lot of niggas is sheep
We don't even know what we like anymore
We just know what the most hype is
Shit, do you really like that shit you like?
Or you like the way they gave it to you?
You know what I'm saying?
Pepsi, Coca-Cola same thing
Dave Chapelle said that, the one that taste the best
Was the one that was paying him the most at the time
That's all that happens with us man
We some weak niggas man, all of us
Followers, sheeps, plural made that shit up
Apologin' ain't no real word my nigga
We know this, but he knows more cause he broke the rules that don't even fucking exist man

141,Lights Turned On,https://genius.com/Childish-gambino-lights-turned-on-lyrics,EP,True,"Small chick with a fat ass
Did I say that out loud? Let me back track
I know my game ain’t that bad
Have you ever made out with a Gap ad?
And girls want what they can’t have
So I don’t text back when the screen flash
You love me? You mean cash
Need a friend you can fuck, I can be that
Crush girls now, couldn’t last year
Oh, you like me now? Well that’s weird
Last year you were chillin’ with Lil Wayne
Now you wanna pretend like my feelings is still the same?
My work is my playtime
I need you to understand and to stay fine
Do this and I just might wife you
Let me poke you, ma, Raichu
Fuck your life
I don’t really think I drank enough tonight
Looking at you, make me wanna fuck for life
Lame ass dudes gon’ suck tonight
But so are these girls, am I wrong or right?
Girl, do somethin’ to me
“Nah, baby, you way too hood for me”
Y’all girls have never been good for me
Watch a nigga take over, mutiny
I wanna fuck with the lights on
Hey, girl, let a python slide on
Stay sick, infect me, Lysol
I’m on the edge, they hoping that I might fall
I make it work, I’m running with a new crew
And we do dope shit you ain’t used to
For me, by me, fuck Fubu
This girl never heard of me, go and check YouTube
I got a house with a dope view
See the ocean, dope shit, you an ’06, I’m an ’02
But enough about high school
I’m getting laid, or I’m getting lied to
You my stand-in Cameron, let me be your A-Rod
You number one in The Pack, Based God
Should I say something dumb to give us something to fight about?
Never mind, lights out
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing
Show me what you do to me, me
Swag
2:30 and we still making progress
Talking on Twitter, see where to go next
3:30, man, where did the time go?
I’m chilling with this Asian chick I met in Chicago
She look like the Social Network chick
Except for her ass is twice as thick, man
Just wanna bite that shit
Where the fuck did my license went?
I must've left it at the other place
I rent a loft downtown with a ton of space
Yeah, we doing stupid shit, have stories when I’m older
But I don’t wanna see pictures of us on Vulture
Never thought about a year ago
I’m chillin’ out with the friends at the Super Bowl
Things change like a motherfuck
That’s why I wild out, keep the city up
Uh, I talk a lot about the girls in my songs
But you are different from the girls in my songs
Stop talking ’bout the girls in my songs
If you don’t like it, I can just take you home
More green than the top of these tree trunks
Leave your boyfriend here, ’cause he bunk
She like, “I’m not a slut”—speed bump
By the way, what’s your name? ‘Cause we drunk
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it 
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose 
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing 
Show me what you do to me, me
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing
Show me what you do to me, me
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing
Show me what you do to me, me

Yea, candy
Uhh, where is this song in my Blackberry?
Yea, yea
Alright cool
Okay
As my mind run licking cotton candy lipstick
You're right here in my room, yeah I wished it
Candlelight vigil for the one you're texting
Pink sweatpants - hmm, interesting
No need, don't explain to me, love
Cause I know how you deal, but I could see us
In a different way, don't play me cause we're not the same
Sign on, sees your screen name and misbehave
So you're a playboy, you think you're Heff kid?
Hoppin' round town with the bunnies when
I'm the candy that you need, brush your sweet tooth
Heard you got me replaced with a statue?
A veneer, I hear, she's just swell
If you want to date a rock, you think I can't tell?
So you bored? Are you lost? Was it worthwhile?
I feel the ice-cold chill in her warm smile
Saw you last night, you didn't have to act foul
Come and sweep me from the back room
Feel my palms heat up on your chest now
As the night creeps into bedtime vows
Married in a white t-shirt, bed style
Still, you know that I'm the best ride
You deserve what you get: it's called respect
You ever heard of it?
I know what you're missing in your new life
I can find a way to make it go right
Make it go right
Make it go right
I know what you're missing in the moonlight
I can fly away and make it go right
It go
It go
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
I used to front somethin' stupid, now I'm makin' them wait
Except for you mama, I'm ready, I don't wanna be late
Never hesitate, you know it, petty cash, we blow it
Excuse me for imperfect, them halfway looks is worth it
I watched these niggas lurkin', they just want my leftovers
Watching Locked Up all day and slept over
Put your hair back: Afro
Skippin' after-parties at the last show
I'mma hold your hand in little Tokyo
And tell you somethin' in your ear that you shouldn't know
Two jumps, but the feeling was so gone
High school swag, busy fuckin' with clothes on
Lost a couple words, joke around the reason
You can wear my shirt, pretend to let you win that FIFA
There was nothing like it...settle down
You always hit me when my boo around
It's a long walk - we ain't talkin', though
That ratchet ho on lock-n-load, I appreciate the offer, though
I'mma do it right - later, though
'Cause, either way, you're gonna hate me like you say you won't
Thank God for that - it's called regret
You ever heard of it?
I know what you're missing in your new life
I can find a way to make it go right
Make it go right
Make it go right
I know what you're missing in the moonlight
I can fly away and make it go right
It go
It go
I know what you're missing in your new life
I can find a way to make it go right
Make it go right
Make it go right
I know what you're missing in the moonlight
I can fly away and make it go right
It go

Fucked on the floor, we ain't gotta speak
Beach, getting high like a motherfuck
Royalty the team so you know what's up
Kitty so good, let me beat it up, kitty so good I could sleep in it
Hollow tip flow sending shots to my enemies
Niggas who tried to Nick Cannon me
Thoughts were so bad that I pleaded insanity
Bottles, I pop me a case
Live on the radio bought me a place
This is my summer of love
Yea, all these bitches is down
But never put nothin' above

Kick it like Kazuya
This game is how we maneuver
There's plenty fish in the sea and I treat them groupies like grouper
My life inside a computer, back up my soul to the cloud
Funny we show 'em class and they call me the class clown
Money is in my jeans, best believe that it's passed down
Got the room thumpin, she tell me don't stop
I mean really don't stop
I must be doing something
Something really on point, something really on point
Now she look back at it
But she give me that look when I gotta dip out
Stop being Dramatic 
Can't nobody do it like this
Forgot her name as soon as I hit
Got that buzz, the phone was silent
Run the game, that's us
Fort Knox, gold bars
Let her get it on both sides, I did it all, with no cosign
And I'm ballin' like I give a fuck
Now they know wassup
Smokin' like she wanna fuck
We are not in love, she's a grown up
And I'm so childish

Rolled up sleeves, nigga lookin’ like a greaser
Word is born, baby my dictionary’s in labor
Listen to the Culdesac and know that was an ultimatum man
Why nobody wanna admit they like me just a little bit?
Won’t be on the freshmen list, guess I’ll just keep spittin’ shit
Never be the rapper with six hundred dollar shades
No iced-out chain, Rod Lavers all day

Everything I’m sayin’, I’m super sayin’ like Goku
Fuck nerdcore, fuck backpack
Fuck rap cool, I make cool rap
I make music for wack blacks to blast back
In fact, I swear the track I lie on’s my last track

Ain’t you read the fucking book Things Fall Apart?
I was never gonna stay the same
All I ever really wanted was to change the game
Spent the year kicking ass and taking names
Try to tell it to your heart, Taylor Dayne
Mama told me I was special when them test scores came in
Calling me the new Will Smith, that’s Jaden
Calling me a faggot when I’m rapping, that’s hating

Ran into Rashida Jones, told me that she heard my song
When I called her mixed like the crowd at my last show
She said to write her something nice on the next track
But she cute, so I wrote her ass a whole rap
Man, I threw that shit away, it felt dumb
Believe me, it was bad, we’re better off, you’re welcome
I worked hard on that song like day and night
That whole song made this one verse, crazy, right?
I guess it all goes somewhere, you know that?
Like that bullshit, you talked before Culdesac
""I didn’t know he had it in him""
Couldn’t see me as Spider-Man, but now I’m spittin’ venom
Now you payin’ attention, pick your fucking face up
When I wanna be a superhero, I just wake up
Renaissance man with a Hollywood buzz
I refuse to go back to not liking who I was because
Fake love, these fake dreams
These fake sounds
All the things that we felt
Your voice was screaming too loud
I know what you’re ready to be 
But it isn’t with me 
So I’m ready to leave you alone
I don’t really wanna fight like this
I don’t ever wanna lose your kiss
All I ever wanted was someone to hold onto

And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out
They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about
Cause hood shit and black shit is super different
So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition
Mom and dad wouldn't listen
They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that
All their friends in NY deal crack
It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em
But when you leave the hood
They think that you look down on 'em
The truth is we still struggle on a different plane
7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same
Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit
But all they get now is, ""Can your son read this script?""
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows
Yeah, Dad lost his job, mama worked at Mrs. Winner's
Gun pulled in her face, she still made dinner
“Donald watch the meter so they don’t turn the lights off""
Workin' two jobs so I can get into that white school
And I hate it there
They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair
And my uncle on that stuff that got my grandma shook
Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book
He’s supposed to pay ‘em back
He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero
So my momma made us sleep with Phillips heads
Under the pillow, like that would do somethin'
But she’s got six kids, she’s gotta do somethin'
She don’t want me in a lifestyle like my cousin
And he mad cause his father ain’t around
He lookin’ at me now, like
""Why you so fuckin lucky? I had a father too
But he ain’t around so I'mma take it out on you""
We used to say ""I love you,"" now we only think that shit
It feels weird that you’re the person I took sink baths with
Street took you over, I want my cousin back
The world sayin' what you are
Because you’re young and black, don’t believe ‘em
You’re still that kid who kept the older boys
From teasin', for some reason
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Oh, help us Lord
Oh, baby, baby, baby"

Okay, Royalty is red hot
Shots from a redbone
Talking bout her skin tone her color beats headphones
Baby I'm just living right, and you can say I'm dead wrong
But can you disagree with that, Versace on me
Got gold on the V-neck I'm passing every G check
Didn't fuck her for a month and never had a regret
It was just nice to have you chilling up in Key West
And we was just chill, I didn't really need sex
But really is we fucking yo
Never serious so I make everything a fucking joke
She be pushing buttons and she push it till that button broke
Then we smoke a blunt and all the drama it go up in smoke
See she just graduated got a new job
Took that nose ring out her nose and went and bought a new Saab
Got that boyfriend that she living with and she don't smoke no more
But, yo, it's cool, I liked her when I knew her back before like
It's those summer days
Never fade away
It just stays the same
In my mind, no no
It's those summer days
Never fade away
Never, never change

I remember
The best time was when well, me and you
We got all our friends and we got a tent
We slept in it
Not the whole night, but just enough time
Magic happened, nothing was born luckily
It's up to me, but
Then we left
The times have changed
The pleasures that I feel
They say you never say never, it's real
Electric eels in the water, we should probably not go deep
I like to stare at you and look at you when you sleep
I'd like to write a poem for you, leave it for you in your room Under the moon, romance
Hold on, brother"

Haters get salty give 'em cholesterol
Trill O.G, mop up the floor with the best of y'all
Then dry that bitch off with the rest of y'all
And catch a flight to Rio de Janero for la festival
Yeah, and that's word to fit a baldy
Ball hard like it's cement inside of my Spalding
And I'll break your face with a no look pass
Now back to your parking lot pimp with yo little hook ass
I use harsh words cause these are hard times
And trill-ass people, nowadays they're such a hard find
So it's one eye open if I could peep ‘em
And one on the scope, so if they frontin' I can sleep 'em

The energy'll blow you over even if you're brolic
Goddamn it, now that's one for the Googlers

Cry a river Timberlake, the whole industry
Record the whole album in my living room in Italy
Niggas who wasn't feelin' me secretly want a handout
Keep your mouth shut, I can probably help your man out
Drop a new stack all lames get to steppin'
Drop a new track all blogs go to heaven
Kill the web, man these niggas need they hits up
Kiss her neck, add a dime to the tip cup
She is not ""slut,"" fuck a dude who says so
Just because she's fuckin' doesn't mean she ain't a lady
Kill the whole stage, I never needed a mic check
Semen on my spacebar, fuckin' tired of Skype sex
Runnin' with a new breed, me and Bun B
This hip-hop nation, that big country
Nigga, please! We ain't stop for no one
Wu-Tang Generator name, I'm a shōgun
Wu-Tang Generator name, watch him smoke one
Talk a lot of shit, but none of them will approach him
Gambino got first position, the game is ballet
So graceful; drive, he don't need a valet
So angel: fly as I wanna be

Dude is so stupid popping anything they hand me
On that parking lot pimping and politicking in Miami
In that home of the D where they sell that cake batter

Changing horses midstream, fourteenth place
On videotape surveillance playback
Sigh you lose face, disgraced, God forbid you
Fall off of the face of the Earth to chase
The black hole of what you thought it was worth today
""Don't shoot the piano player"" I heard them say
It was your fault, centrifugal force, you got caught
Convict monotonous, a verdict thoughtless
As you read it out loud, at least I was being relatively honest
Standing in your office trying to speak to some anacondas
Eking solace out of the sawdust
While your doppelganger stands topless
No one notices, they got their own dramas
Drama-rama's melodramas
You draw commas on the eyes of madonnas
And wonder why you can't turn traumas into nirvanas
Don't mess your head up, still run with these young bucks
Still runnin' on jet fuel, still pimpin' on what-what
What was I thinkin'? I wasn't; What am I drinkin'? I'm buzzin'
Speakin' of weekends I used to fuck with your cousin
I used to rap about nothin', now I rap about nothin'
But that nothin' was somethin' that ain't nobody was bumpin'
See I still got it boo-boo, just a dad'll do you
Wonders if you don't wanna be under some gross dude
But most girls will do it just for a corner seat at Nobu
I bet your daughter's perfect, he say it like he know you

Someone tell these niggas I ain't fuckin' 'round
Fly them all to Vegas man we hold it down
Livin' for the present, nigga we fuck futures
Sippin' on some whiskey, these bitches drinkin' Kombucha
Recession means more oppression, these niggas will shoot ya
Rio de Janeiro, these bitches lookin' like Xuxa
Talk with anacondas, at least I'm bein' honest

Since the evening, colors flash before my eyes
I feel like a child, so young and new in '92
I listened to what my father said
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
There is a voice inside us all
So smile when you can, when you can
How this used to feel so far and free
Now these broken souls are all I see
Fists have fallen to our side
We may cry alone, I feel we know where all of this is headed
But my mama said
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
Oh I, nah, nah, nah
If you are strong, you cannot fall
If you are strong, oh no
There is a voice inside us all
So smile, ohh, when you can, ohh, when you can
If you cannot, oh!
There is more to you and me
There is more than they can see
I'm on your side, woo, oh
There is more out there
And somebody cares 'bout you
I do
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
There is more out there
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Oh!
Give me a moment, oh, oh, oh
When they're gone, keep to yourself
Oh, oh, woo, oh, ooh, yeah!
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Oh! Oh!
Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Oh! Oh!
(Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall)
Ooh! Oh!"
210,Sunrise,https://genius.com/Childish-gambino-sunrise-lyrics,Camp,True,"Yeah nigga, it's me again
I'm still around, I guess I win
You hear me in your sister's room like all the time
""Gambino Girl forever"" on that bracelet that she bought online
To dudes who couldn't take it, might I say, ""Hasta luego""
'Cause I'm takin' all your city like I'm Carmen San Diego
I am smokin', I'm on fire
I am blazin', don't get hurt
To my white dudes, it's a concert
To my black nerds, this is church
From that NYU dorm to the Emory
Everyone hated me, I'm more hip-hop than you'll ever be
I'm bustin', bustin', bustin', I'm bustin' on these niggas, man
And nothin', nothin' nothin', n-nothin' is the same again
You lookin' dumb as hell man for ever sleepin' on him
Your girl is not around, she busy sleepin 'on him
Will he fail? Now that's the wrong conversation
Terry Gross on the mic, I'm the talk of the nation, ha
 What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy
 What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy
New shit, you didn't know?
Black rock like a fuckin' LOST episode
Somethin' for these black kids to call they own
So when you skatin' in your driveway, you not alone
She stay down like that new coat that I bought her
And the fly Rihanna girls be drinkin' my coconut water
And I'm lookin' at her butt, that's that 20/20 hindsight
My shit be Jackson, Jordan, Bolton, Keaton, Tyson, 5 Mikes
Donald Glover, no relation
Always workin', no vacation
They couldn't feel me, no vocation
Murder verses the only motive was motivation
Money equals freedom
I've wanted this since a three-year-old
I've seen it all, like I'm John Mayer's penis hole
Bein' me, that's somethin' that's so unusual
I've seen the future, and the future go, ah
 What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy
 What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy
New shit
Can't you hear me, baby?
Can't you hear me callin' out your name?
Can't you hear me, baby?
Ohh, can't you hear me callin' out your name?"

Do you misbehave?
Haunt you to your grave
I'm going to eat you alive

But I don't eat fast food
So don't run too fast
Just hide, ooh!

All that I could do, but you don't even feel me though
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh oh
So CG, but a nigga stay real though
I'm fly, I'm ill, I'm runnin' shit
3-points, field goal
Rappers used to laugh like I tripped and fell
Cause I don't stunt a gold cross like I Christian, bail
Yeah, they starin' at me jealous 'cause I do shows bigger
But your looks don't help like an old gold digger
Uncool, but lyrically I'm a stone cold killer
So it's 400 blows to these Truffaut niggas
Yeah, now that's the line of the century
Niggas missed it, too busy, they lyin' 'bout penitentiary
Man, you ain't been there, nigga you been scared
And I'm still livin' single like Synclaire
Lovin' white dudes who call me white and then try to hate
When I wasn’t white enough to use your pool when I was eight
Stone Mountain, you raised me well
I’m stared at by Confederates, but hard as hell
Tight jeans, penny loafers, but I still drink a fo' dime
Staying on my me shit, but hated on by both sides
I’m just a kid who blowin' up with my father’s name
And every black ""You're not black enough""
Is a white ""you're all the same""
Mm Food like Rapp Snitch Knishes
'Cause it's Oreos, Twinkies, coconuts, delicious
How many gold plaques you want inside your dining room?
I said, ""I want a full house""
They said, ""You got it, dude""
All these haters, see you later
All that I could do, but you don't even feel me though 
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh oh
Holla, holla, holla, holla at your boy
Like your dad when he's pissed off
Got flow, I could make a cripple crip walk
Niggas' breath stank, all they do is shit talk
People want a real man, I made 'em wait this long
Maybe if he bombs, he'll quit and keep actin'
And save paper like your aunt does with McDonald napkins
How'd it happen? Honesty did it
See all of my competition at the bodies exhibit
Yeah, I bodied the limits and I deaded them fakers
Motherfuck if you hate it, cremated them haters
So, my studio be a funeral
Yeah, this is our year, oh you didn't know?
Uh, yeah I'm killin' you, step inside the lion's den
Man I'm hov if the 'O' was an 'I' instead
On stage wit' my family in front of me
I am what I am: everything I wanna be
All these haters, see you later
All that I could do, but you don't even feel me though
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh oh
This is on a bus back from camp
I’m thirteen and so are you
Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes
I hadn’t met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble
It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That’s you
And we’re still at camp as long as we’re on the bus
And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us
We’re still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pineneedles
I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you
But I don’t know if you do or don’t more-than-like me
You’ve never said, so I haven’t been saying anything all summer
Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me
And choosing to do so again the next day and so on
A girl who’s smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh
Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh
But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be
A girl who reads books that no one’s assigned to her
Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it
From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet
Back in the real world we don’t go to the same school
And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood
We won’t go to the same high school
So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something
And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something
The sun’s gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep
We’re talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop
That looks like a kid we know
And then I’m like, “Can I tell you something?”
And all of a sudden I’m telling you
And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming
And your face is there and gone and there and gone
As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway
And there’s no expression on it
And I think just after a point I’m just talking to lengthen the time
Where we live in a world where you haven’t said “yes” or “no” yet
And regrettably I end up using the word “destiny”
I don’t remember in what context. Doesn’t really matter
Before long I’m out of stuff to say and you smile and say, “okay”
I don’t know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive
And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment
But there’s nowhere to go because we’re on a bus
So I pretend like I’m asleep and before long, I really am
I wake up, the bus isn’t moving anymore
The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on
I turn and you’re not there
Then again a lot of kids aren’t in their seats anymore
We’re parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church
The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad’s car by now
Your bags and things piled high in the trunk
The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time
Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus
Just as one of them reaches my row
It used to be our row, on our way off
It’s Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week
After throwing rocks at my head
Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise
She stops and looks down at me
And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can’t really see her face
But I can see her smile. And she says one word: “destiny”
Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh
And then she turns and leads them off the bus
I didn’t know you were friends with them
I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over
So is summer, even though there’s two weeks until school starts
This isn’t a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad
This is a story about how I learned something and I’m not saying this thing is true or not
I’m just saying it’s what I learned
I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody
So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always
Everybody can’t turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them
But this means there isn’t a place in my life for you or someone like you
Is it sad? Sure. But it’s a sadness I chose
I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy
And got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit
But that’s not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus
I still haven’t"

I know the secret we share
Look what this feeling has done to me
There's something deep in the air
Just hope your hands lift me comfortably
I don't know why but every time I see you smiling
I'm tired of running tired of playing tired of hiding
If we could be together would that make you happy?
And If it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
I think there's something for us
Lying around as the world comes down
If you understand what I'm saying
You won't end up in the lost and found, nope
I don't know why but every time I see you dancing
I'm tired of running tired of playing late romancing
If we could be together would that make you happy?
And if it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me

Smoke a J at the beach like this
Hang with bae at the beach like this

Mess around make a hit like this

Eddy Scissorhands is workin' on my linin' 
Gettin' spiffy for these bitches I be eyeing
Fredward Mercury was playin' while I'm ridin' 
Down the Ryan, in a Scion 
And I'm flyin', but it's cool, I got insurance
On the run, because I got warrants 
But it's cool I got endurance
In school I got suspended, but in turn I got some earnings
Could've spent it all on Thursday, but I saved it for my parents
But I spent a bit on Friday, in the night I hang with Donald
And I'm tired of McDonald's, want a chick that cook Chicano
That can't speak a lick of English
And pronounce my name like ""Chano""
She say ""something, something"" Spanish
I look back like, ""Bitch, I-I know""

Crew at my house and we party every weekend so

Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it

I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hol' up
No matter what you say or what you do 
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you 
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up 
Hol' up , hol' up 
Hol' up , hol' up 
Hol' up , hol' up 
Hol' up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up 
Hol' up , hol' up 
Hol' up , hol' up 
Hol' up , hol' up 
Hol' up 
Hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up
Na—na—na, na—na—na—na—na
We did it! Yay!
Nigga, you so thirsty"

260,We Ain’t Them,https://genius.com/Childish-gambino-we-aint-them-lyrics,Royalty,True,"Pickin' out my fro with my fist comb
I got a tab at the Stone baby, this long
My little brother was havin' a little trouble
I hope that he doesn't care that it's in this song
Koreatown lunchin', talkin' 'bout how to run things
He said Atlanta wanted something
Waka, Jeezy, and Future got the streets locked down
Copycats making sure Tip keep that crown
I'm fucking 'round with the truth, went to see The Roots
Quest brought me back on stage in a suit
I went hard 'cause niggas say that I'm soft
Even Black Thought thought I maimed it a little hard, I gotta be honest
Feelin' like the other stuff is kinda behind us
Makin' jokes here and there done got us some dollars
I'm tryna show the whole world what it is and it ain't a game
He said ""Homie, stay the course, ain't shit changed
Weird night and everybody was tipsy
Hanging out with Questlove reminiscin' 'bout Whitney
He like, ""Man, we can't even make it to 50?!""
That reminds me, I sent a long text message to my mom and pop
I got the same speech when I left 30 Rock
My mom like, ""Why you wanna leave a good job?""
My dad like, ""Do your thing, boy, don't stop""
Shout out to my nigga Lud, shout out to my nigga Swank
For hangin' at the crib and telling me what you think
Speak from your heart and never compromise what you feel is real
And never let these white people tell you how to feel
Never let anybody tell you how to feel
I wanted what they had back in the fourth grade
Family vacays, you know I did it all
Just to see my little sis by a waterfall
My great granddad bought his own freedom
Walk barefoot to Virginia to start his own peanut farm
So don't be alarmed, man, I'm royalty
Jam of the week, V103
No cosign, no bovine
More swag, pull back on the punchlines
Starvin', every track means lunch time
Huh, I'm a star, how could I not shine?
Fuck boys chase hype and scrat chicks
And niggas who stopped textin' after 1.6
DG Lover ain't nothin' to fuck wit'
D-Money ain't nothin' to fuck wit'
And what's a leader if he isn't reluctant
Too bad for y'all, I'm blastin' off
I'm not Asher Roth, I don't sleep on my bread
Dick riders stay close, I might flash a ball
Sometimes, all this shit make a nigga feel guilty
I used to sleep with them roaches
Back of my mind though, I hope the show gets canceled
Maybe then I can focus
Hawaii touch down, go ahead baby, put your shades on
East Side! East Side to the gravestone!
Brown liquor, but my girl in Bed-Stuy
Nigga, you got Drive like a sale at Best Buy, uh
Hold up, hold up, we can do better
Put my voice on the track, man that shit is much wetter
At the studio at 8 A.M
Hit the booth then eat, nigga we ain't them, nigga we ain't them!
Drop a line, it's your Facebook status
Said that shit about a week ago, you still mad at us
If there's something on your chest, nigga let it out
'Cause I'm the best, da-da-da"
267,Wonderful,https://genius.com/Childish-gambino-wonderful-lyrics,Royalty,True,"We finally made it
And now we sailin’
I never dreamed we’d get this far
My heart keeps askin'
How'd it get so wonderful? So wonderful
How'd it get so wonderful? 
So wonderful 
You can call the shots, I’m going to my aunt’s house
What’s it all about? Lookin’ like I’m Millhouse
What’s it all about? I ain’t get my bike back
I ain’t get my bike back, I know where he live at
I know what he look like, I know what I live like
Five to a bed, head to toe, that’s a good night
Five to a bed, head to toe, with the fan on
I don’t think these other niggas know what ya man on
I used to have to sneak just to get my food
Free lunch made it feel like they don’t approve
Sell a card for a dollar used to be the move
I wanna be Jabari man, that nigga cool
I wanna lash out, nigga keep your cool
All my friend did was draw something now he outta school
‘Cause everything was always “Show me what you made of”
And everybody knew somebody who was laid up
I didn’t need it, mama said it’s a lesson
Some people will never like you
Don’t let ’em catch you stressin’
You know a code’s a code, the world can’t stop ’em
Eating out rat holes and Cheerios boxes
This nigga think he hot shit, he think he good at everything
I just didn’t wanna get left out more
My little sis’ mom got shot, she in the newspaper
Prayers couldn’t save her, she died a day later
Like my cousin got that HIV
When she bust the leg open playing jump rope
Should I tell them kids what the fuck’s up?
They gon' judge her and me
Man fuck them, we livin’, all is forgiven
I fucked up royally
But now that’s who we are man, you gotta use the royal ""we""
This is royalty, and this is all I ever wanted ‘cause
We finally made it
And now we're sailin’
I never dreamed we’d get this far
My heart keeps askin'
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful
We finally made it
And now we're sailin’
I never dreamed we’d get this far
My heart keeps askin'
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful 
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful"
268,Won’t Stop,https://genius.com/Childish-gambino-wont-stop-lyrics,Royalty,True,"We are so far away from here
Tell 'em run it back, this song is my shit
Told that DJ ""Turn it up!"", all we did was Blowflex 
It’s that Stone Mountain, DeKalb county
Fuck boys know shit 'bout me
Still real, no shit, cash gun, money clip
285 to 400 then I made a left 
Man, we spend it up in Lenox, boy, we fresh to death
They be sleepin' when I left, now they heard of me
We get paid to get y’all hyped, that’s that turnip green
New kicks, street ball 
Black top, asphalt
Tight dress, her ass fault, get face like bath salts
Airport atheist, only pray when there's turbulence
So why the fuck am I stressin’ over this nervous shit?
We are so far away from here
We are so far away from here
Burn, burn, burn
My new car , my new clothes 
Now that I’m on top, are you proud of me?
Burn, burn, burn 
My new car , my new clothes 
Now that I won't stop, are you proud of me?
All I really wanted was a left turn
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned
Now that I’m on top, are ya proud of me, proud of me?
All I really wanted was a left turn
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned
Now that I’m on top, are ya proud of me, proud of me?
Are you proud of me?
Are you proud of me?
Na-na-na-no-no-no
Na-na-na-no-no-oh
I shoulda known
Na-na-no, shoulda known
Shoulda known"
273,You See Me,https://genius.com/Childish-gambino-you-see-me-lyrics,Camp,True,"I'm on my ballin' each and every day
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
You see me babe? You see me babe?
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
I'm on my ish, call it
I watch these haters take they shots like they were alcoholics
""What is he wearing? Somebody jack that fool's steeze""
If I'm a faggot spell it right, I got way more than two G's
Nigga I'm amazing, I'm a phenom
I'm assassin, I'ma kill y'all
I'ma say ma ma sa, ma ma ma coo sa
And this shit's closed now cause I ball too hard
And I'm cumming on her face, have I gone too far?
I don't know, who cares, I don't love that broad
And it's funny how these fake niggas always act hard
I'm a black star in a black car with a black card
They wanna knock me out
They tryin nigga
Realest motherfucker in the game like Tron, nigga
Forget these white girls
I need some variation
Especially if she very Asian
She got an ugly friend? Roll solo
Can I stay at your place? No hobo
Not my fault, man, these ladies love me
She's an overachiever 'cause all she do is succeed
I'm on my ballin' each and every day
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
You see me, babe? You see me babe?
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
Send me naked pics, I’ma Tumbl that
I’m the shit, been the shit, fuck a humble brag
Yeah we pushin’ that, and her pussycat
I got swag out my ass so I’m usin’ that
Texting with Olivia Munn, hopefully, she’ll give me some
Or some Rosie Jones, man
Hoes is hoes is hoes, man
Racks on racks on racks, man
All I got is tracks, man
Sorry for my accent, but I’ve been practicin’
Everywhere ya go niggas blastin’ that Gambino
Niggas be like, ""You ain't know?""
Bitches be like, ""You ain't know?""
Met this fly Latino
Hope that she eighteen though
If she not, I’ll say that I got deep throat in Heathrow
I'm on my ballin' each and every day
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
You see me, babe? You see me babe?
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
Told me I was shit, but that shit couldn't stop me
Nigga still hungry, black Kobayashi
When I talk about you I hear a ""Who?"" like Horton
I was born for this shit, you a rappin' abortion
Can we hear the N-word one day and not get upset?
Can we try something new and not be suspect?
I don’t really know, we fucked up bad
You don’t wanna see my dudes when they get mad
I got a bunch of jackanapes at the back of me
That’ll lacerate anyone in the back of a matinee
And laugh while they masturbatin' all over your beaten body
Sick Boi forever, that Suburban Illuminati
Naw nigga, yeah, we never stop
No period like menopause
No period like, ""Oh shit! Am I the only one you sleepin' with?""
""Am I the only one you sleepin' with?"""

Breathing down your spine, oh
